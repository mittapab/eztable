AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) usually have no specific
      symptoms until an advance stage of the disease and curative treatment is not
      possible. Patients with early stage, operable disease can be found using
      ultrasonography (US). A US-screening program was implemented in Thailand where
      CCA incidence is the highest worldwide. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of the
      program by comparing the proportion of individuals with early stage CCA in the
      screening group with that of the walk-in group presenting at hospitals with
      clinical symptoms. METHODS: All patients had a pathological diagnosis of CCA. The
      difference in the proportions and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained 
      using binomial regression. RESULTS: Of the 762 histologically proven CCA cases,
      161 were from the screening group and 601 from the walk-in group. The proportion 
      of early stage CCA (stages 0 to II) diagnosed was 84.5% in the screening and
      21.6% in the walk-in groups. After adjustment age, gender, and liver fluke
      infection, there was a significantly higher proportion (P < 0.001) and higher
      chance (P < 0.001) of having early stage CCA in the screening group than in the
      walk-in group. CONCLUSIONS: US-screening is an effective tool for detecting early
      stage, operable CCA in high incidence areas.
